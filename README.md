🍷 Michelin Star Restaurant Analysis & Prediction in France

This project explores Michelin Guide restaurants across France (and worldwide) to uncover insights about cuisine, pricing, and geographic distribution. My ultimate goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a restaurant is likely to earn a Michelin star based on its characteristics.

As a food enthusiast with a passion for French cuisine, I chose this dataset to combine my hobby of cooking with my data analytics and machine learning skills.

📜 Project Overview

The Michelin Guide is one of the most prestigious restaurant rating systems in the world. The dataset includes key variables such as:
	•	Restaurant name
	•	City and country
	•	Cuisine type
	•	Price range
	•	Michelin stars (0, 1, 2, 3)

With these features, this project will:
	1.	Analyze restaurant distributions across cuisines, cities, and price levels.
	2.	Compare Michelin-starred vs. non-starred restaurants.
	3.	Develop predictive models to estimate the likelihood of a restaurant receiving stars.
	4.	Focus specifically on French restaurants to highlight regional culinary trends.

🚀 Approach Summary

Data Analysis
	•	Distribution of cuisines and price levels.
	•	Geographic mapping of Michelin restaurants in France.
	•	Correlation between cuisine, city, and Michelin stars.

Feature Engineering
	•	Encoding categorical features (cuisine, city, country).
	•	Normalizing price categories.
	•	Creating regional variables (Paris vs. other cities).

Modeling
	•	Classification task: predicting Michelin stars (binary or multi-class).
	•	Models to test: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost.
	•	Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
